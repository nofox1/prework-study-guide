# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

To really challenge myself to learn a new skill and computer languages. I built this project to insure my understanding of the basic coding langauges in website development. The problem that was solved in the prework study guide was organization for a coder. I learned a lot in this prework project such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git bash. That was just a few new things that I've learned but also learned how to stay organized as coder using github and VS code.

If I open my Prework Study Guide I can also navigate to the DevTools console where we can see the JavaScript actually running the list of topics that were covered in the prework and at random is chooses what topic to study.
